            <h4>Brief about Ian Hernandez</h4>
            <p>
                I am a U.S. Army Veteran. I am also an IT hobbyist. I have been playing with computers from a young age and have
                learned and grown as technology has. I like to experiment and learn new skills within the IT field all the time,
                and will continue to grow in the IT industry. I am attending Illinois Institute of Technology for a bachelors in
                Information Technology and Management, and am going to start a masters in Cyber Forensics and Security.
